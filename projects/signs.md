## Artificial intelligence for inspection of railway safety sign 

ProRail, the railway infrastructure manager in the Netherlands, wanted to improve the safety of their railway tracks by ensuring that safety signs were in the right place and in good condition. They had a lot of data but needed help to make sense of it.

A algorithm was developed for detecting the location and condition of safety signs along the railway tracks using artificial intelligence. The algorithm needed to be able to compare the location of each safety sign with the existing documentation, detect the condition of each sign, and automate the quality control process.

I used my expertise in image recognition, signal processing and photogrammetry to improve the algorithm that could detect the GPS location of each safety sign and compare it with the existing documentation.

The algorithm was successful, and ProRail decided to futher implement it into their regular workflow. The algorithm will help ProRail to improve their asset management, save time and manpower, and ultimately make the railway safer for everyone.
