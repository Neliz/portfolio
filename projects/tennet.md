## Wintrack Fullscale Tests (signal processing)

As a data analyst, I was involved in the testing of the Hoogspanningsmast Wintrack 3. The mast was designed to optimize and improve the energy transfer of high-voltage cables. My role was to analyze the data from the tests and report to the team. Additionally, I was responsible for overseeing the measurement system during the tests.

My task as a measurement technician was to collect, analyze, and interpret the data from the tests. I used various software tools and programming languages to process and visualize the data. I also worked closely with the testing team to ensure that the tests were conducted properly and that the data was collected accurately. Additionally, I was responsible for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the measurement system during the tests.

To analyze and report on the test data, I took several actions. I collected data from various sensors installed on the mast, strain(electric and fibre optics), force and displacementsensor, accelerometers, Total Station (3D displacements) and weahter conditions. I processed and analyzed this data to see how the mast performed under different conditions.

I also developed various algorithms and models to analyze and predict the data. For example, I determined the natural frequency of the mast for the different modes.

As a measurement technician , I contributed to the successful testing of the Hoogspanningsmast Wintrack 3. By analyzing and interpreting the data, we gained insight into the mast's performance under different conditions. We were able to validate the design and make recommendations for improvements. Thanks to my work as a data analyst and my oversight of the measurement system, we were able to optimize the energy transfer of the Hoogspanningsmast Wintrack 3.
